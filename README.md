ðŸŽ¯ About
Week 4 - The main goal of this week is to transform the static site previously developed during the Genesis program and turn it into a web application on MVC (Model - View - Controller) foundations. The site must be in a state that allows you to create a new section that saves the Javascript form that calculates an estimate in the form of a purchase order.
Expanding the relational database model
Seeding data base with data NB: real address are used

Week 5 - During this week, participants are exposed to a more elaborate data model and must perform basic query exercises. They will be asked to create tables, alter them and extend the concepts managed by their information system.
Two types of databases will be requested for this exercise
a- A relational database
b- A data warehouse for decision-making

# **Life is a Web Service**

To improve your services and products offering , it is not always necessary to solve all the problems yourself and reinvent the wheel. In reality, many solutions are already available to meet the needs of many products and services such as those offered by Rocket Elevators. A large number of products and services exist today to allow an enriched and optimal experience from the beginning to the end of the value chain.
During the API week, the participants gathered in a team will have to collaborate to take advantage of seven implementations, which they will make with some of the most used products on the market:

*	Google Maps
*	Twilio
*	Slack
*	DropBox
*	SendGrid
*	IBM Watson
*	ZenDesk
