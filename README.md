ðŸŽ¯ About
Week 4 - The main goal of this week is to transform the static site previously developed during the Genesis program and turn it into a web application on MVC (Model - View - Controller) foundations. The site must be in a state that allows you to create a new section that saves the Javascript form that calculates an estimate in the form of a purchase order.
Expanding the relational database model
Seeding data base with data NB: real address are used

Week 5 - During this week, participants are exposed to a more elaborate data model and must perform basic query exercises. They will be asked to create tables, alter them and extend the concepts managed by their information system.
Two types of databases will be requested for this exercise
a- A relational database
b- A data warehouse for decision-making

# **Life is a Web Service**

To improve your services and products offering , it is not always necessary to solve all the problems yourself and reinvent the wheel. In reality, many solutions are already available to meet the needs of many products and services such as those offered by Rocket Elevators. A large number of products and services exist today to allow an enriched and optimal experience from the beginning to the end of the value chain.
During the API week, the participants gathered in a team will have to collaborate to take advantage of seven implementations, which they will make with some of the most used products on the market:

*	Google Maps
*	Twilio
*	Slack
*	DropBox
*	SendGrid
*	IBM Watson
*	ZenDesk

# Introduction to week 7 (API WEEK)

During the API week, the participants gathered in a team will have to collaborate to take advantage of seven implementations, which they will make with some of the most used products on the market:
**Rocket Elevators' information system** continues to evolve. It now has a website, operational functions in its back office and the ability to perform business intelligence using its data warehouse and graphic rendering capabilities of key facts in their context.
The time has now come to increase the functional capacities of certain sections of the information system in order to:
1.	Provide a rich experience for website visitors and clients.
2.	Improve **Back Office** 

In order to achieve these objectives, the product team has identified certain capabilities offered by APIs (**Application Programming Interfaces**) published by specialized partners and accessible in SaaS (Software as a Service) mode via subscriptions. The functionalities to be implemented must meet specific requirements.

The Ruby on Rails implementations delivered must serve as the foundation for this new iteration of the information system.


# The Requierement

![picture](/app/assets/images/mapsmale.jpg)

**The Google Maps API** is known for its great maturity, performance and geospatial rendering capabilities. It can therefore be used as an extension within our secure back office (reserved for Rocket Elevators employees) in order to geolocate our customers on a map and display statistics on a location:

* *Instruction:*

The geolocation page must be a page in the Admin section of the website, available only to authenticated members.
The addresses table of the database, if it is not already the case, must now include real addresses, geolocalizable by Google Maps.

* *To Access:*
    
    * On  the Rocket Elevators pages:

        * log in to: MY ACCOUNT

            - with user name: admin@admin.com
            - with Password: password

    This will give you access to the BackOffice Dashboard.

    * Click on *Map*

    You have now access to the location and details on our clients indicated by marker. You will also notice the actual weather on the specific marker.

**How we did it**
1. Install 
    [Geocoder](https://rubygems.org/gems/geocoder/versions/1.3.7?locale=fr)

    Provides object geocoding (by street or IP address), reverse geocoding (coordinates to street address), distance queries for ActiveRecord and Mongoid, result caching, and more. Designed for Rails but works with Sinatra and other Rack frameworks too.
2. Creating [API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

    The API key is a unique identifier that authenticates requests associated with your project for usage and billing purposes. You must have at least one API key associated with your project

# Twilio

    [Twilio](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-ruby)



# Slack
![picture](/app/assets/images/slacksmall.png)

**The Slack API** is very open and flexible, thus Rocket Elevators could greatly benefit from synergy between all of the company's collaborators. The Backoffice in particular may  be able to publish messages on Slack to leave written records and inform about certain events that occur through its infrastructure.
